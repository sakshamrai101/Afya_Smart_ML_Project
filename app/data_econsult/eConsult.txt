 Recommendations 

Recommendations:

1. X-ray of the left knee to confirm the diagnosis of a possible fracture in the left leg.
2. Doppler ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the patient's complaints of leg pain and swelling.
3. Complete blood count (CBC) to rule out any signs of infection or abnormality in the blood related to the injury.

Medication Recommendation:
1. Prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen for pain relief and to reduce inflammation.
2. Consider prescribing acetaminophen for additional pain control if NSAIDs are not sufficient.
3. Provide information on the proper use of prescribed medications, including dosage, frequency, and potential side effects.

Patient Education/Management:
1. Educate the patient on the importance of rest, elevation, and ice therapy to reduce pain and swelling in the affected leg.
2. Instruct the patient to avoid putting weight on the injured leg and to use crutches as needed for mobility.
3. Emphasize the importance of attending the follow-up appointment in 1 week for reassessment and to discuss any concerns or changes in symptoms.
