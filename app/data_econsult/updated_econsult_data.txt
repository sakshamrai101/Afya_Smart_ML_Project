 Recommendations 

Diagnostic Testing Recommendations:
1. Order MRI of the brain to evaluate for possible tumor given the patient's symptoms of persistent headaches, nausea, weakness on the left side, and positive Babinski sign.

Medication Recommendation:
2. Prescribe anti-nausea medication to help alleviate the patient's symptoms of nausea. This can provide symptomatic relief while further diagnostic testing and management are underway.

Patient Education/Management:
3. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up appointments for review of MRI results and the treatment plan. Encourage the patient to keep a record of symptoms and any changes they may experience. Additionally, provide information on lifestyle modifications to help manage hypertension and hyperlipidemia, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adherence to prescribed medications.
